**Projest Proposal**

Admittedly, I have struggled to come up with an idea for my project, though the activity we did in class did help generate some ideas. I think I want to do something with the saying "money doesn't grow on trees," but intertwine it with climate change and forest fires. This isn't a fully developed thought; I plan on attending office hours to hash through it a bit more because I think a visual with this idea would be interesting and a challenge to create, hopefully filling some aspirational criteria. 

I also considered doing an anti-smoking campaign poster based on Nike's "Just Do It" slogan, but changing it to say "Don't Do It" or "Just Quit It." With this idea, I would have a cigarette shaped like the well-known Nike swoosh and the slogan underneath, mimicing a Nike advertisement.
