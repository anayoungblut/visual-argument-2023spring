**Projest Proposal**

Admittedly, I have struggled to come up with an idea for my project, though the activity we did in class did help generate some ideas. I think I want to do something with the saying "money doesn't grow on trees," but intertwine it with climate change and forest fires. This isn't a fully developed thought; I plan on attending office hours to hash through it a bit more because I think a visual with this idea would be interesting and a challenge to create, hopefully filling some aspirational criteria. 

I also considered doing an anti-smoking campaign poster based on Nike's "Just Do It" slogan, but changing it to say "Don't Do It" or "Just Quit It." With this idea, I would have a cigarette shaped like the well-known Nike swoosh and the slogan underneath, mimicing a Nike advertisement.

**Progress Reflection 2/16**

I decided to go with the anti-smoking campaign poster idea that mimics the well-known Nike campaign and slogan. Thus far, I have done some research on Nike campaigns I find especially powerful, such as the Colin Kaepernik campaign with Nike; these visual arguments feature a black and white background image with the Nike logo and some words layered on top. I hope to create a visual argument of my own with this anti-smoking campaign. I found a background image I like and that fits the aesthetic I am going for. I have also found an image that contains the Nike logo and have cropped it so that just the logo is included, though there is still a black box encasing the logo that I cannot get to go away. I’ve done the same with a cigarette image by finding one that I feel will work well and cropping the background so that it is just the cigarette. This crop was more successful. 

My next steps are a bit more complicated. First, I need to figure out how to get that black box to go away from around the Nike logo. This is definitely user error on my part and I need to play around some more to get it to disappear. I then need to figure out how to warp the cigarette into the shape of the Nike logo without making it look too unrecognizable. This will be the trickiest part of my project. Third, I need to write out my altered Nike slogan, “Just Don’t” or “Don’t Do It,” under the altered cigarette form. I already have a font chosen from the website provided by Dr. Miller, though I need to upload it into GIMP to be able to use it. I’m also going to include a few statistics on smoking at the bottom of my campaign to add a layer and some credibility. Most of my issues boil down to my unfamiliarity with GIMP, so I definitely need to figure things out for myself.


**2/16 Reflective Writing in Class**

What is challenging about my peice is that I cannot figure out how to get this cigarette to shape into a Nike swoosh. I have a good vision for my final product, but executing it is where I get tripped up. I hope I can hone in my skills and make a visually appealing final product that lives up to my expectations. I am excited because I think it will be a clean final product considering how simple my idea is, but I also think there is a lot to say about simplicity and how appealing it can be.

A visual argument works well when it makes sense as a whole piece. For instance, it may have good symmetry or cohesive coloring. Something to avoid is making a piece too "busy," meaning too many things going on whether those things are fonts, colors, shapes, words, TEXTURES, etc.

I SWITCHED TO PHOTOSHOP AND MY PROJECT IS WORKING OUT I FIGURED OUT THE FEATURES AND ALSO CAME UP WITH AN IDEA TO MAKE IT LOOK EVEN BETTER YAY

**Update 2/21**

I am happy with how my visual argument is turning out. I think it is very clean and easy to look at. It is also east to understand the message. I hope that people understand it is meant to mimic the Nike “Just Do It” campaigns. Two of my biggest worries are that it violates copyright laws with Nike since it uses the same format and similar fonts as well as that it is too simple, almost to the point where it doesn’t meet baseline criteria. I have over three layers between the background, cigarette, smoke, “DON’T DO IT” text, and statistic text (five layers total), but I worry that they do not seem developed enough to be interesting.

In terms of aspirational criteria, I used the warp and distort tools on the smoke to shape it into the iconic Nike Swoosh. I think I should increase the opacity or brightness of the smoke so it stands out against the background more. I also want to make the cigarette blend in with the smoke more; right now, I feel that it seems like it was just dropped in the middle of my page and does not blend in seamlessly. Going forward, those will be the two things I choose to focus on. I do want to make sure I achieve a grade higher than the baseline B grade, so I might need to get creative with adding elements and using new tools. The only issue is, I am not sure what to add that will fit in with the piece instead of just adding stuff for the purpose of adding it. I also want to stick with the Nike campaign theme, so adding anything will be difficult since the theme is so simple.

Something I am happy with is my decision to switch to Photoshop. It has been much easier to use thus far, and tutorials are easier to come by. I also like how all the transformation tools are under one header, so they are easy to find.
