**Projest Proposal**

Admittedly, I have struggled to come up with an idea for my project, though the activity we did in class did help generate some ideas. I think I want to do something with the saying "money doesn't grow on trees," but intertwine it with climate change and forest fires. This isn't a fully developed thought; I plan on attending office hours to hash through it a bit more because I think a visual with this idea would be interesting and a challenge to create, hopefully filling some aspirational criteria. 

I also considered doing an anti-smoking campaign poster based on Nike's "Just Do It" slogan, but changing it to say "Don't Do It" or "Just Quit It." With this idea, I would have a cigarette shaped like the well-known Nike swoosh and the slogan underneath, mimicing a Nike advertisement.

I decided to go with the anti-smoking campaign poster idea that mimics the well-known Nike campaign and slogan. Thus far, I have done some research on Nike campaigns I find especially powerful, such as the Colin Kaepernik campaign with Nike; these visual arguments feature a black and white background image with the Nike logo and some words layered on top. I hope to create a visual argument of my own with this anti-smoking campaign. I found a background image I like and that fits the aesthetic I am going for. I have also found an image that contains the Nike logo and have cropped it so that just the logo is included, though there is still a black box encasing the logo that I cannot get to go away. I’ve done the same with a cigarette image by finding one that I feel will work well and cropping the background so that it is just the cigarette. This crop was more successful. 

My next steps are a bit more complicated. First, I need to figure out how to get that black box to go away from around the Nike logo. This is definitely user error on my part and I need to play around some more to get it to disappear. I then need to figure out how to warp the cigarette into the shape of the Nike logo without making it look too unrecognizable. This will be the trickiest part of my project. Third, I need to write out my altered Nike slogan, “Just Don’t” or “Don’t Do It,” under the altered cigarette form. I already have a font chosen from the website provided by Dr. Miller, though I need to upload it into GIMP to be able to use it. I’m also going to include a few statistics on smoking at the bottom of my campaign to add a layer and some credibility. Most of my issues boil down to my unfamiliarity with GIMP, so I definitely need to figure things out for myself.

What is challenging about my peice is that I cannot figure out how to get this cigarette to shape into a Nike swoosh. I have a good vision for my final product, but executing it is where I get tripped up. I hope I can hone in my skills and make a visually appealing final product that lives up to my expectations. I am excited because I think it will be a clean final product considering how simple my idea is, but I also think there is a lot to say about simplicity and how appealing it can be.

A visual argument works well when it makes sense as a whole piece. For instance, it may have good symmetry or cohesive coloring. Something to avoid is making a piece too "busy," meaning too many things going on whether those things are fonts, colors, shapes, words, TEXTURES, etc.
